# StoryForge: The Collaborative Story Platform

StoryForge is a full-stack web application that allows users to collaboratively write stories. One user starts a story, and the community submits and votes on the next "canon" chapter. It also features a "multiverse" mode to explore all the "paths not taken."

## üöÄ Core Features

* **User Authentication:** Secure registration and login using JWT and bcrypt password hashing.
* **Create Stories:** Logged-in users can start new stories by writing the first chapter.
* **Collaborative Submissions:** Any user can read a story and submit their idea for the *next* chapter.
* **Community Voting:** Users can vote on their favorite pending submissions.
* **Canonization:** The original story author has "Author Controls" to end voting, count the results, and promote the winning chapter to the official "canon."
* **The Multiverse:** Don't let good writing go to waste! Users can explore all the non-canon (losing) submissions for every chapter to see "what could have been."
* **Real-time Polling:** The story page automatically polls for updates, so users see new submissions and chapter advances without reloading.

## üèÅ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes `npm`)
* A running [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) database

### 1. Backend Setup

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-project-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-project-name.git)
    cd your-project-name/backend
    ```
2.  Install NPM packages:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Create a `.env` file in the `backend` folder and add your environment variables:
    ```.env
    # Your PostgreSQL connection string
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://YOUR_USER:YOUR_PASSWORD@localhost:5432/YOUR_DB_NAME"
    
    # A long, random string for signing tokens
    JWT_SECRET="YOUR_SUPER_SECRET_RANDOM_STRING"
    ```
4.  Run the server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The backend will start (by default on `http://localhost:3001`).

### 2. Frontend Setup

1.  In a **new terminal**, navigate to the frontend folder:
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    ```
2.  Install NPM packages:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Run the React development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
4.  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.
